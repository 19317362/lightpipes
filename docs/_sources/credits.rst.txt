**Gleb Vdovin**

LightPipes was written by Gleb Vdovin in 1990 for MS DOS.
the output of a command was the input for the next command. Gleb used the "pipe" feature of MS DOS, that's why it is called LightPipes. The source code of LightPipes for UNIX can be obtained for free from http://www.okotech.com.

**Fred van Goor**

Fred rewrote the commands for using them in Mathcad and Matlab in 1994. Later he made a version for Python (2017).
The Mathcad and Matlab versions (not free) can be obtained from Flexible Optical, http://www.okotech.com. 
The Python version can be obtained for free from https://github.com/opticspy/lightpipes. He also developed the LightPipes for Python website using Sphinx.
