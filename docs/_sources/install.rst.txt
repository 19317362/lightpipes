Installation.
*************

This Python version of Lightpipes can be operated on Windows (32 and 64 bits), Linux (32 and 64 bits) and Macintosh (64 bits) computers.
There exist packages for Python versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6.
LightPipes for Python is on `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/LightPipes/>`_ and can be installed if you have `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_ installed on your computer.
In a terminal window simply type:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install LightPipes

To test if the installation was successful start Python and type at the prompt:

    >>> from LightPipes import *
    >>> LPTest()
    LightPipes for Python: test passed.
    >>>
    
The response should be: "LightPipes for Python: test passed."

Most output from LightPipes python scripts should use the `MatPlotLib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ plotting library.
MatplotLib can be installed by typing in a terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install matplotlib

Another useful package is `Tkinter <https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html>`_ to make graphical user interfaces (GUI). It is installed already with most Python installations.
See http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html how to install it on your platform.

Finally, a convenient editor to make Python scripts is `Geany <http://www.geany.org/>`_.
